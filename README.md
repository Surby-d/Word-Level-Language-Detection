# Word-Level-Language-Detection
This project is a part of TopCoder Challenge.
The objective of this challenge is to build a python tool that detects the language of each word in romanized script and returns the words annotated with the detected langauage. 

The script primarily does the following:

-> Take a list of text as input: The tool should be able to take as input a list of text from a json file, where each text piece is processed independently.

-> Language detection (English, Hindi and Spanish): For each piece of text in the list, perform language detection on each word

-> Return the list of annotated text: Once detection is complete, the list of text with each word language-annotated, is returned by the tool.
